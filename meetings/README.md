# Meetings

## Guidelines
1. See the file labled yyyymmdd_notes_outline.md for a meeting notes template. Of course, you could use other formatting for notes, but git displays markdown automatically.
1. copy the template to a new file, fill it in and commit.
1. Start the filename with the date - YYYYMMDD so that they sort nicely. Please include your own name in the filename. 
1. add the agenda at the top of the file.  
1. This file (Readme) can hold agenda items for next call.

# Next call: TBD
