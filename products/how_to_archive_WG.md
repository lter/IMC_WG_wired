# How to Archive an LTER IMC working group
## Background
An archived working group is one that is no longer active. Active working groups are more complex. 

## Goals of an archive

1. IMC can find material from an inactive WG (and does not add more material to im.lternet.edu)
1. NCO has a record of the work IMC has done
1. IMC WGs have a presence in the general LTER WG area

## Steps

Process for a WG to archive their materials. 
This should be coordinated by the WG chair, or other knowledgable volunteer.

1. Archive WG section at im.lternet.edu 
    1. download static docs 
    1. create pdfs from html pages 
    1. put them all into a zip
2. Mark the section at im.lternet.edu as "ARCHIVED" 
3. Coordinate with NCO
    1. Find the working group landing page; consolidate if necessary
    1. TBD: deposit the archive in a final resting place (doc archive?)
    1. write a final report -> doc archive
    1. assemble for landing page:
        1. abstract
        1. links to products (min = report)
        1. link to  git or svn
