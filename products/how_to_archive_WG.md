An archived working group is one that is no longer active. Active working groups are more complex. 

Goals of an archive
1. IMC can find material from an inactive WG (and does not add more material to im.lternet.edu)
1. NCO has a record of the work IMC has done
1. IMC WGs have a presence in general the LTER WG area



Here is a first pass at an outline of the process a WG might use to archive their materials:

1. archive WG section at im.lternet.edu 
    1. (download docs, create pdfs of html pages, put them all into a zip)
2. mark that section as "ARCHIVED" 
3. TBD: deposit the archive in a final resting place (doc archive?)
4. write a final report -> doc archive
5. also TBD ?? per NCO protocols, 
    1. write an abstract or whatever short bit of documentation they want? 
    1. maybe for a wg landing page (if one exists)?
    1. list and URL for products?
