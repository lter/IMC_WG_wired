An archived working group is one that is no longer active. Active working groups are more complex. 

Goals of an archive
1. goal 1
1. goal 2



Here is a first pass at an outline of the process a WG might use to archive their materials:

1. archive WG section at im.lternet.edu
2. mark that section as "ARCHIVED" 
3. TBD: deposit the archive in a final resting place (doc archive?)
4. write a final report -> doc archive
5. also TBD ?? per NCO protocols, write an abstract or whatever short bit of 
documentation they want? maybe for a wg landing page (if one exists)?
