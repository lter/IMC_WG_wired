# How to Move an LTER IMC working group (not EDI or LTER)
# Background
Some working groups have communities which are larger than LTER or EDI. 
Material from an active working groups should be moved to an area where collaborative work can 
continue. This may be associated with a wiki or git repository of some other organization.

## Goals

1. Material remains public (new material not added to im.lternet.edu)
1. IMC WG has a presence in the general LTER WG area

## Steps

Process will vary depending on the practices of the hosting organization.
This should be coordinated by the WG chair, or other knowledgable volunteer. 

3. Coordinate with NCO
    1. Find the working group landing page; consolidate if necessary
    1. assemble for landing page:
        1. abstract
        1. link to external material, etc.
